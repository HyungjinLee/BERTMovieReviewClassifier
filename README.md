These are a series of experiments for KHU Capstone Design Project 2019.

Such a shame¡¦ Environments where I have been doing experiments are completely different. 

* Deep Learning Environments

BERT (My Model) -> MXNET
Text_Claasification_CNN, Bi_LSTM -> Tensorflow 

So I¡¯ll share all the GitHub links respectively. From this way, I think it is gonna be much easier to execute them.

I don't have any GPUs :) So that's why I've done these kinds of experiments on a GPU Server. If you don¡¯t, you might be working on it with your CPU which will take so long time¡¦ (A day per one epoch) I highly recommend using GPUs.

 * English Datasets
# Train Data - 170K Plain Texts that contain polarity labels respectively. (Not Movie Reivews)
# Test Data - Kaggle Movie Review Corpora that contain polarity lables respectively.

 * Korean Datasets

# Train Data - 150K Plain Texts that contain polarity labels crawled from Naver Movie.
# Test Data - 50K Plain Texts that contain polarity labels crawled from Naver Movie.
